UTXO Blockchain Implementation
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of a blockchain using UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) models to manage transactions. It provides functionality for creating UTXOs, signing and verifying transactions, and processing transactions between users.

Project Structure
bash
Copy code
/your-project
├── utxo.py              # Blockchain implementation (class with UTXO management and transaction processing)
└── main.py              # Script to run the blockchain example with Alice, Bob, and Charlie
Requirements
Python 3.8 or higher
cryptography package for cryptographic operations (can be installed via pip install cryptography)
Features
UTXO Management:

Generates UTXOs (Unspent Transaction Outputs) for recipients.
Tracks UTXOs in a dictionary (utxo_set).
Transaction Signing and Verification:

Creates and signs transactions using elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).
Verifies transaction signatures to ensure integrity and authenticity.
Blockchain Transaction Processing:

Transfers funds between users, updates the UTXO set, and manages balances.
Supports basic transaction flow (spending UTXOs and generating new ones).
Logging:

Provides logging for key operations such as UTXO creation, transaction processing, and errors.
How to Use
Clone or download the repository.
Install the required dependencies using pip install cryptography.
Run the main.py script to simulate a blockchain environment with transactions between Alice, Bob, and Charlie.
Example Workflow
Alice generates a UTXO with 100 coins and sends 30 coins to Bob.
Bob then sends 20 coins to Charlie.
The system ensures that Alice and Bob have sufficient funds and creates new UTXOs accordingly.
Code Explanation
utxo.py
Blockchain Class:
Manages the UTXO set and ledger of transactions.
Supports methods to generate private/public key pairs (generate_keys), create new UTXOs (create_utxo), sign transactions (sign_transaction), and verify transactions (verify_transaction).
The process_transaction method handles the logic for transferring funds, verifying the transaction, and updating the UTXO set.
main.py
Main Functionality:
Demonstrates how the Blockchain class can be used to simulate transactions between Alice, Bob, and Charlie.
It first creates an initial UTXO for Alice, then processes transactions between users, printing the UTXO set at each stage.
